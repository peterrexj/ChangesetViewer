            <h2>Changeset Viewer</h2>
        </div>
        <p>This plugin will allow you list and filter changeset in the TFS easily. It connects to TFS which is connected in the current instance of Visual Studio. Search result can match text and append hyperlinks to it, for example a support request number which can be navigated to a URL to read more about it. Also highlights the work item Id against which the changeset was checked in and each result can be exported to EXCEL.</p>
        <div>
            <p>Features:</p>
            <ol style="">
                <li>Search based on comment </li>
                <li>Search comment on exact or keyword match</li>

                <li>Search in particular branch</li>
                <li>All the above can be combined</li>
                <li>Add ticket link in the comment</li>
                <li>Go to a particular changeset </li>

                <li>Export the search result to excel spreadsheet</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Use case (some):</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Search changeset checked in today or last one week or last one month in a particular branch</li>
                <li>Search based on ticket number and find how many changesets are related to that</li>
                <li>Search based on user and with  some feature mentioned in the comment</li>
                <li>Search based on a date range</li>
                <li>Search based on reviewer</li>
                <li>Find tickets and read about the tickets easily (tickets can have hyperlink as configured in the settings)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>When Visual studio is not connected to TFS, the search will not happen and it will open the TFS connect window to help connect one of the servers. Servers can be changed at any time, which the plugin will automatically refresh. Exporting to excel has a predefined template, future release will have customized template. </p>
            <p><b><i></i>Know Issue:</b>Each search will sweep entire changeset, so some or most of the cases, it is preferred to stop the search after sometime. For example, search for today, it can be stopped once there are no changeset returned for a while, which does not make sense to search throughout the changeset collection. Future release will handle this problem.</p>
